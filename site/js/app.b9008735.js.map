C’est une manière de faire des codes avec des symboles. </p> <p> Dans ce code, plutôt que de remplacer une lettre par une autre, les inventeurs ont préféré remplacer les lettres par des symboles pour diffuser leurs messages codés car ils étaient membres de sociétés secrètes et ne voulaient pas que tout le monde puisse comprendre leur message. </p> <p> Le temple était, à l’époque, un ordre de moines dont la mission première était d’assurer la sécurité des pèlerins en Terre Sainte. Rapidement, les templiers (moines du temple) s’éloignèrent de cette mission et s’enrichirent au point de devenir les trésoriers du roi et du Pape. Pour coder les lettres de crédit, qu’ils s’échangeaient et qu’ils voulaient secrètes, ils remplaçaient chaque lettre par un symbole comme vous pouvez le voir sur l’image. </p> <img class=img-center src=\" + ___HTML_LOADER_REPLACER_0___ + \"> <br> <p> Le code des templiers utilisé chez les scouts en est une variante !

Tu peux retrouver l’alphabet du code des templiers ci-dessous. </p> <img class=img-center src=\" + ___HTML_LOADER_REPLACER_1___ + \"> <br> <p> <i>Mais comment décoder ce code quand on n’a pas l’alphabet sous les yeux ?</i> <br> Le code est construit grâce à 4 dessins dans lesquels on ajoute les lettres dans l’ordre. Si tu as un message suivant le code des templiers devant les yeux, il faut donc que tu retrouves quel symbole correspond à quelle lettre. </p> <p> Pour cela tu dois d’abord dessiner 2 grilles non fermées à l’extérieur de 3 cases de hauteur et 3 cases de largeur puis 2 grands X. Ensuite dans toutes les cases de la 2ème grille et dans tous les V du deuxième X, tu mets un point. Il ne te reste plus qu’à compléter avec lettres de l’alphabet dans l’ordre. Normalement tu obtiens les dessins comme ceux ci-dessous. </p> <img class=img-center src=\" + ___HTML_LOADER_REPLACER_2___ + \"> <br> <p> Expérimente en essayant de décoder le code ci-dessous : </p> <img class=img-center src=\" + ___HTML_LOADER_REPLACER_3___ + \"> </div> </div> <div id=page3> <div class=blockquote> <h1>Etape 2 : Le code « chinois »</h1> <h2>Le code « chinois » mais qu’est-ce que c’est ?</h2> <p> Tu as croisé des codes avec des lignes verticales et horizontales croisées mais tu t’es toujours demandé ce que c’était… Ce code est appelé communément le code « chinois ». On le surnomme aussi le code du « secret des loups » des Scouts et Guides de France. Ce code utilisé pour cacher des messages paraît compliqué mais nous allons te dévoiler son fonctionnement et il n’aura plus aucun secret pour toi ! </p> <img class=img-center src=\" + ___HTML_LOADER_REPLACER_4___ + \"> </div> </div> <div id=page4> <div class=blockquote> <h1>Etape 2 : Le code « chinois »</h1> <h2> Le code « chinois », comment ça marche ?</h2> <p> Le code « chinois » suit une logique particulière qu’il faut comprendre pour pouvoir décoder facilement. Pour construire un code « chinois », on parcourt d’abord les voyelles dans l’ordre : A, E, I, O, U, Y. Elles sont toutes symbolisées par des lignes horizontales. Pour chaque voyelle, une ligne en plus est ajoutée, cela fonctionne comme sur la photo. </p> <img class=img-center src=\" + ___HTML_LOADER_REPLACER_5___ + \"> <br> <p> Puis, on récite les lettres de l’alphabet qui suivent la dernière voyelle obtenue pour faire une nouvelle ligne verticale à chaque consonne. (Pour chaque consonne il y a donc un certain nombre de lignes horizontales qui correspondent à la voyelle présente juste avant la consonne dans l’alphabet et un certain nombre de lignes verticales qui corresponde au nombre de consonnes dans l’alphabet après la voyelle désignée pour atteindre la voyelle qu’on veut écrire.) Vous pouvez voir sur l’image le fonctionnement pour les consonnes. </p> <img class=img-center src=\" + ___HTML_LOADER_REPLACER_6___ + \"> <br> <p> Au final, l’alphabet donne en code chinois ceci : </p> <img class=img-center src=\" + ___HTML_LOADER_REPLACER_7___ + \"> <br> <p> Décode le message suivant et passe à la page suivante </p> <img class=img-center src=\" + ___HTML_LOADER_REPLACER_8___ + \"> </div> </div> <div id=page5> <div class=blockquote> <h1>Etape 2 : Le code « chinois »</h1> <h2>Le code « samouraï », frère du code « chinois » …</h2> <p> Sur ta route scoute, il pourra aussi t’arriver de retrouver du code samouraï… il faut faire attention à ne pas le confondre avec le code chinois parce qu’ils sont frères et qu’il est lui aussi constitué de bâtons horizontaux et verticaux. Tu te demandes alors mais quelle est la différence entre les 2 ? La réponse est simple, le code « chinois » et le code samouraï fonctionnent de la même façon sauf que, dans le code samouraï les voyelles sont représentées par les lignes verticales et les consonnes par les lignes horizontales (c’est l’inverse du code « chinois » !). </p> <img class=img-center src=\" + ___HTML_LOADER_REPLACER_9___ + \"> </div> </div> <div id=page6> <div class=blockquote> <h1>Etape 3 : A toi de jouer !</h1> <p> Ta mission, ici, est de décoder le code « samourai » ci-dessous (voyelles en lignes verticales et consonnes en lignes horizontales).

Dans ce sens, c'est une limitation physique ou psychique. En effet, il existe plusieurs types de handicap, en voici quelques uns : <strong class=font-weight-bold>Le handicap moteur :</strong> c’est l’ensemble des problèmes entraînant une atteinte partielle ou totale de la motricité, par exemple des membres supérieurs (ex : bras) et/ou inférieurs (ex : jambes). C’est une difficulté pour se déplacer, conserver ou changer une position, prendre et manipuler, effectuer certains gestes. <br> <img class=img-center src=\" + ___HTML_LOADER_REPLACER_0___ + \"> <br> <strong class=font-weight-bold>Le handicap sensoriel </strong> regroupe les difficultés liées aux organes sensoriels comme par exemple : <strong class=font-weight-bold>le handicap visuel</strong>, qui concerne les personnes aveugles, mais aussi, dans la majorité des cas, les personnes malvoyantes. <br> <img class=img-center src=\" + ___HTML_LOADER_REPLACER_1___ + \"> <br> <strong class=font-weight-bold>Le handicap mental ou intellectuel :</strong> c’est une difficulté à comprendre et une limitation dans la rapidité des fonctions mentales sur le plan de la compréhension, des connaissances et de la cognition. <br> <img class=img-center src=\" + ___HTML_LOADER_REPLACER_2___ + \"> <br> <h2>Est-ce que tous les handicaps se voient ?</h2> Non, il existe plusieurs types de handicap, dont certains qui ne se voient pas comme par exemple parfois l’autisme. Par exemple, certains chercheurs pensent aujourd’hui que Einstein aurait été autiste Asperger (c’est une forme de handicap mental). <br><strong class=font-weight-bold>Peut-on être scout et en situation de handicap ? </strong><br> Oui ! Chez les scouts, on accueille tout le monde, régulièrement des unités accueillent des jeunes handicapés. De plus, il existe une branche chez les scouts et guides de France dédiée spécifiquement aux personnes majeures en situation de handicap, elle s’appelle : « vent du large ». Il existe aussi un groupe « Arc en ciel » à Marseille qui n’accueille que des jeunes en situation de handicap mental ou moteur. </div> </div> <div id=page3> <div class=\\\"blockquote text-center\\\"> <h1>Troisième temps</h1> Le troisième temps de cette activité est une activité manuelle sensibilisant au handicap moteur : la dyspraxie. <br> <p class=font-italic>Consigne : Pour comprendre mieux et ressentir ce qu’est le handicap moteur réalise ces étapes l’une après l’autre.</p> <ol> <li>Ecris sur une feuille la phrase suivante (il faut que les mots soient assez espacés entre eux) : <span class=font-italic>« Le handicap, la différence sont une forme de singularité, qui mettent en avant d'autres qualités insoupçonnées. »</span></li> <li>Maintenant, mets des gants de ski ou des gants de jardinage.
