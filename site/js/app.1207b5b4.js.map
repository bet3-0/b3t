consommeront du carburant.<br> </p> <p> <b>Ils répondent au bon moment à nos besoins nutritionnels :</b> la nature est bien faite et nous offre tout ce dont nous avons besoin au bon moment !<br> En hiver, avec le froid et le manque de soleil, notre corps réclame plus de nutriments et notre système immunitaire a besoin d’un petit coup de fouet : tant mieux, c’est la saison des légumes riches en minéraux et des agrumes pleins de vitamine C.<br> En été, avec la chaleur, notre organisme dépense moins de calories mais demande plus d’eau : tous les fruits et légumes de la saison en sont gorgés : melon, salade, tomate, courgette, fruits rouges, etc. !<br> </p> <p> <b>Ils sont moins traités :</b> hors saison, un fruit ou un légume viendra soit d’une récolte sous serre, où il a été aspergé de pesticides pour l’aider à pousser et pour compenser le manque de soleil et de nutriments dans le sol ; soit d’un pays lointain où les produits phytosanitaires ne sont pas forcément aussi réglementés qu’en Europe.<br> Et ces pesticides sont de plus en plus montrés du doigt sur de nombreux cas de cancers, d’infertilité et autres maladies modernes, et se retrouvent également dans les nappes phréatiques et ont un impact sur toute l’écologie locale.<br> </p> <p> <b>Ils sont moins chers :</b> les produits de saison et locaux demandent bien sûr moins de transports et pas de taxe d’importation, ce qui se répercute sur le prix.<br> </p> <p> En résumé, moins de pesticides, moins de carburant utilisé…Que du bon pour l’environnement et pour toi ! </p> <p> D’ailleurs, peut-être

Rapidement, les templiers (moines du temple) s’éloignèrent de cette mission et s’enrichirent au point de devenir les trésoriers du roi et du Pape. Pour coder les lettres de crédit, qu’ils s’échangeaient et qu’ils voulaient secrètes, ils remplaçaient chaque lettre par un symbole comme vous pouvez le voir sur l’image. </p> <img class=img-center src=\" + ___HTML_LOADER_REPLACER_0___ + \"> <br> <p> Le code des templiers utilisé chez les scouts en est une variante !

Tu peux retrouver l’alphabet du code des templiers ci-dessous. </p> <img class=img-center src=\" + ___HTML_LOADER_REPLACER_1___ + \"> <br> <p> <i>Mais comment décoder ce code quand on n’a pas l’alphabet sous les yeux ?</i> <br> Le code est construit grâce à 4 dessins dans lesquels on ajoute les lettres dans l’ordre. Si tu as un message suivant le code des templiers devant les yeux, il faut donc que tu retrouves quel symbole correspond à quelle lettre. </p> <p> Pour cela tu dois d’abord dessiner 2 grilles non fermées à l’extérieur de 3 cases de hauteur et 3 cases de largeur puis 2 grands X. Ensuite dans toutes les cases de la 2ème grille et dans tous les V du deuxième X, tu mets un point. Il ne te reste plus qu’à compléter avec lettres de l’alphabet dans l’ordre. Normalement tu obtiens les dessins comme ceux ci-dessous. </p> <img class=img-center src=\" + ___HTML_LOADER_REPLACER_2___ + \"> <br> <p> Expérimente en essayant de décoder le code ci-dessous : </p> <img class=img-center src=\" + ___HTML_LOADER_REPLACER_3___ + \"> </div> </div> <div id=page3> <div class=blockquote> <h1>Etape 2 : Le code « chinois »</h1> <h2>Le code « chinois » mais qu’est-ce que c’est ?</h2> <p> Tu as croisé des codes avec des lignes verticales et horizontales croisées mais tu t’es toujours demandé ce que c’était… Ce code est appelé communément le code « chinois ». On le surnomme aussi le code du « secret des loups » des Scouts et Guides de France. Ce code utilisé pour cacher des messages paraît compliqué mais nous allons te dévoiler son fonctionnement et il n’aura plus aucun secret pour toi ! </p> <img class=img-center src=\" + ___HTML_LOADER_REPLACER_4___ + \"> </div> </div> <div id=page4> <div class=blockquote> <h1>Etape 2 : Le code « chinois »</h1> <h2> Le code « chinois », comment ça marche ?</h2> <p> Le code « chinois » suit une logique particulière qu’il faut comprendre pour pouvoir décoder facilement. Pour construire un code « chinois », on parcourt d’abord les voyelles dans l’ordre : A, E, I, O, U, Y. Elles sont toutes symbolisées par des lignes horizontales. Pour chaque voyelle, une ligne en plus est ajoutée, cela fonctionne comme sur la photo. </p> <img class=img-center src=\" + ___HTML_LOADER_REPLACER_5___ + \"> <br> <p> Puis, on récite les lettres de l’alphabet qui suivent la dernière voyelle obtenue pour faire une nouvelle ligne verticale à chaque consonne. (Pour chaque consonne il y a donc un certain nombre de lignes horizontales qui correspondent à la voyelle présente juste avant la consonne dans l’alphabet et un certain nombre de lignes verticales qui corresponde au nombre de consonnes dans l’alphabet après la voyelle désignée pour atteindre la voyelle qu’on veut écrire.) Vous pouvez voir sur l’image le fonctionnement pour les consonnes. </p> <img class=img-center src=\" + ___HTML_LOADER_REPLACER_6___ + \"> <br> <p> Au final, l’alphabet donne en code chinois ceci : </p> <img class=img-center src=\" + ___HTML_LOADER_REPLACER_7___ + \"> <br> <p> Décode le message suivant et passe à la page suivante </p> <img class=img-center src=\" + ___HTML_LOADER_REPLACER_8___ + \"> </div> </div> <div id=page5> <div class=blockquote> <h1>Etape 2 : Le code « chinois »</h1> <h2>Le code « samouraï », frère du code « chinois » …</h2> <p> Sur ta route scoute, il pourra aussi t’arriver de retrouver du code samouraï… il faut faire attention à ne pas le confondre avec le code chinois parce qu’ils sont frères et qu’il est lui aussi constitué de bâtons horizontaux et verticaux. Tu te demandes alors mais quelle est la différence entre les 2 ? La réponse est simple, le code « chinois » et le code samouraï fonctionnent de la même façon sauf que, dans le code samouraï les voyelles sont représentées par les lignes verticales et les consonnes par les lignes horizontales (c’est l’inverse du code « chinois » !). </p> <img class=img-center src=\" + ___HTML_LOADER_REPLACER_9___ + \"> </div> </div> <div id=page6> <div class=blockquote> <h1>Etape 3 : A toi de jouer !</h1> <p> Ta mission, ici, est de décoder le code « samourai » ci-dessous (voyelles en lignes verticales et consonnes en lignes horizontales).

consommeront du carburant.<br> </p> <p> <b>Ils répondent au bon moment à nos besoins nutritionnels :</b> la nature est bien faite et nous offre tout ce dont nous avons besoin au bon moment !<br> En hiver, avec le froid et le manque de soleil, notre corps réclame plus de nutriments et notre système immunitaire a besoin d’un petit coup de fouet : tant mieux, c’est la saison des légumes riches en minéraux et des agrumes pleins de vitamine C.<br> En été, avec la chaleur, notre organisme dépense moins de calories mais demande plus d’eau : tous les fruits et légumes de la saison en sont gorgés : melon, salade, tomate, courgette, fruits rouges, etc. !<br> </p> <p> <b>Ils sont moins traités :</b> hors saison, un fruit ou un légume viendra soit d’une récolte sous serre, où il a été aspergé de pesticides pour l’aider à pousser et pour compenser le manque de soleil et de nutriments dans le sol ; soit d’un pays lointain où les produits phytosanitaires ne sont pas forcément aussi réglementés qu’en Europe.<br> Et ces pesticides sont de plus en plus montrés du doigt sur de nombreux cas de cancers, d’infertilité et autres maladies modernes, et se retrouvent également dans les nappes phréatiques et ont un impact sur toute l’écologie locale.<br> </p> <p> <b>Ils sont moins chers :</b> les produits de saison et locaux demandent bien sûr moins de transports et pas de taxe d’importation, ce qui se répercute sur le prix.<br> </p> <p> En résumé, moins de pesticides, moins de carburant utilisé…Que du bon pour l’environnement et pour toi ! </p> <p> D’ailleurs, peut-être

Dans ce sens, c'est une limitation physique ou psychique. En effet, il existe plusieurs types de handicap, en voici quelques uns : <strong class=font-weight-bold>Le handicap moteur :</strong> c’est l’ensemble des problèmes entraînant une atteinte partielle ou totale de la motricité, par exemple des membres supérieurs (ex : bras) et/ou inférieurs (ex : jambes). C’est une difficulté pour se déplacer, conserver ou changer une position, prendre et manipuler, effectuer certains gestes. <br> <img class=img-center src=\" + ___HTML_LOADER_REPLACER_0___ + \"> <br> <strong class=font-weight-bold>Le handicap sensoriel </strong> regroupe les difficultés liées aux organes sensoriels comme par exemple : <strong class=font-weight-bold>le handicap visuel</strong>, qui concerne les personnes aveugles, mais aussi, dans la majorité des cas, les personnes malvoyantes. <br> <img class=img-center src=\" + ___HTML_LOADER_REPLACER_1___ + \"> <br> <strong class=font-weight-bold>Le handicap mental ou intellectuel :</strong> c’est une difficulté à comprendre et une limitation dans la rapidité des fonctions mentales sur le plan de la compréhension, des connaissances et de la cognition. <br> <img class=img-center src=\" + ___HTML_LOADER_REPLACER_2___ + \"> <br> <h2>Est-ce que tous les handicaps se voient ?</h2> Non, il existe plusieurs types de handicap, dont certains qui ne se voient pas comme par exemple parfois l’autisme. Par exemple, certains chercheurs pensent aujourd’hui que Einstein aurait été autiste Asperger (c’est une forme de handicap mental). <br><strong class=font-weight-bold>Peut-on être scout et en situation de handicap ? </strong><br> Oui ! Chez les scouts, on accueille tout le monde, régulièrement des unités accueillent des jeunes handicapés. De plus, il existe une branche chez les scouts et guides de France dédiée spécifiquement aux personnes majeures en situation de handicap, elle s’appelle : « vent du large ». Il existe aussi un groupe « Arc en ciel » à Marseille qui n’accueille que des jeunes en situation de handicap mental ou moteur. </div> </div> <div id=page3> <div class=\\\"blockquote text-center\\\"> <h1>Troisième temps</h1> Le troisième temps de cette activité est une activité manuelle sensibilisant au handicap moteur : la dyspraxie. <br> <p class=font-italic>Consigne : Pour comprendre mieux et ressentir ce qu’est le handicap moteur réalise ces étapes l’une après l’autre.</p> <ol> <li>Ecris sur une feuille la phrase suivante (il faut que les mots soient assez espacés entre eux) : <span class=font-italic>« Le handicap, la différence sont une forme de singularité, qui mettent en avant d'autres qualités insoupçonnées. »</span></li> <li>Maintenant, mets des gants de ski ou des gants de jardinage.

Après tout, elle a peut-être aussi envie de dévaler la pente en fauteuil et en ayant une personne de plus dans l’équipe, vous pouvez vous relayer pour pousser le fauteuil de Sonia et lui permettre de jouer un maximum. </div> Un de tes copains t’avoue avec beaucoup de difficultés que parfois son papa lui donne des coups... (il est vrai que tu avais déjà remarqué dans la tente ses nombreux bleus dans le dos et sur les jambes). </div> </div> <div id=page8> <div class=\\\"blockquote text-center\\\"> <div class=\\\"alert alert-warning\\\"> <h4 class=alert-header>Réponse précédente</h4> Cette situation peut sembler te dépasser complètement, tu n’es pas sûr de tout comprendre mais tu sais que ça peut être grave. Tu peux décider - avec l’accord de la personne concernée - d’en parler à l’un de vos chefs. Tu peux également lui demander s’il en a déjà parler à quelqu’un et lui conseiller de trouver un adulte en qui il a confiance pour en discuter. N’aie pas peur d’en parler (sans jamais accuser quelqu’un si ce n’est pas toi la victime)... Et si aucun adulte proche de toi n’est suffisamment digne de confiance, tu peux téléphoner au 119, c’est un numéro gratuit où les enfants peuvent venir confier leurs problèmes. </div> Prendre soin de soi (santé, émotions, sommeil, etc.) est important pour être bien dans son corps et dans sa tête. Dans ta tribu et dans ton équipage, vous êtes entre scouts et guides pour vivre ensemble : rire, vous aider, jouer, relever des défis et pleins d’autres aventures. Vous pouvez compter les uns sur les autres et tes chefs et cheftaines sont également là pour toi. </div> </div> </div>\";\n// Exports\nmodule.exports = code;","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"img/5_maracas_yaourt.49826416.jpg\";","// Module\nvar code = \"<div class=container> <div id=page1> <h2>Question 1</h2> <h3>Le sais tu ?</h3> <p>Sais tu comment retrouver ton chemin grâce au soleil ?</p> <p>Après avoir réfléchi, que tu aies la réponse ou pas, regarde plus bas</p> <h3>Quelques indices pour trouver la réponse</h3> <details> <p> Comment surnomme-t-on le Japon ? <br> Pourquoi la Bretagne est-elle connue pour ses couchers de soleil ? </p> <p>Regarde plus bas pour voir la réponse</p> </details> <h3>Le savais-tu ?</h3> <details> <p> Le Japon est souvent surnommé le Pays du soleil levant.

Ils ont autant besoin d’eau que nous. Donc, des traces convergentes de gibiers mènent forcément à l’eau. </p> <p> Dans la famille des humains, on repère l’eau car on sait que tout humain a besoin d’eau pour vivre. Pour cela, loin de la civilisation, on suit les traces de pas qui mèneront sûrement à un puit, une source ou un trou d’eau. On peut aussi guetter les ponts, les barrages et les panneaux qui les indiquent également. </p> </details> </div> <div id=page7> <h2>Question 7</h2> <h3>Le sais tu ?</h3> <p> Dans la famille des animaux, les insectes sont un bon guide pour trouver l’eau.

Et dans quel périmètre autour des mouches on peut trouver de l’eau ? </p> <p>Après avoir réfléchi, que tu aies la réponse ou pas, regarde plus bas</p> <h3>Le savais-tu ?</h3> <details> <p> Les ruches d’abeilles se trouvent à moins de 5 km de l’eau et les mouches sont à moins de 90 m de l’eau. </p> </details> </div> </div> \";\n// Exports\nmodule.exports = code;","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"img/9_jonglage1.902dc9d0.png\";","// Module\nvar code = \"<div class=container> <div id=page1> <div class=\\\"blockquote text-center\\\"> Nous allons te proposer des situations d’urgence.
