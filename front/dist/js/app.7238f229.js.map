n’auront pas de goût, et bien sûr plus ils consommeront du carburant.<br> </p> <p> <b>Ils répondent au bon moment à nos besoins nutritionnels :</b> la nature est bien faite et nous offre tout ce dont nous avons besoin au bon moment !<br> En hiver, avec le froid et le manque de soleil, notre corps réclame plus de nutriments et notre système immunitaire a besoin d’un petit coup de fouet : tant mieux, c’est la saison des légumes riches en minéraux et des agrumes pleins de vitamine C.<br> En été, avec la chaleur, notre organisme dépense moins de calories mais demande plus d’eau : tous les fruits et légumes de la saison en sont gorgés : melon, salade, tomate, courgette, fruits rouges, etc. !<br> </p> <p> <b>Ils sont moins traités :</b> hors saison, un fruit ou un légume viendra soit d’une récolte sous serre, où il a été aspergé de pesticides pour l’aider à pousser et pour compenser le manque de soleil et de nutriments dans le sol ; soit d’un pays lointain où les produits phytosanitaires ne sont pas forcément aussi réglementés qu’en Europe.<br> Et ces pesticides sont de plus en plus montrés du doigt sur de nombreux cas de cancers, d’infertilité et autres maladies modernes, et se retrouvent également dans les nappes phréatiques et ont un impact sur toute l’écologie locale.<br> </p> <p> <b>Ils sont moins chers :</b> les produits de saison et locaux demandent bien sûr moins de transports et pas de taxe d’importation, ce qui se répercute sur le prix.<br> </p> <p> En résumé, moins de pesticides, moins de carburant utilisé…Que du bon pour l’environnement et pour toi ! </p> <p> D’ailleurs, peut-être faudrait-il apprendre à Obélix à manger des légumes pour accompagner ses sangliers ? </p> <p> Allez, à ton tour d’apprendre les fruits et légumes de saison

Rapidement, les templiers (moines du temple) s’éloignèrent de cette mission et s’enrichirent au point de devenir les trésoriers du roi et du Pape. Pour coder les lettres de crédit, qu’ils s’échangeaient et qu’ils voulaient secrètes, ils remplaçaient chaque lettre par un symbole comme vous pouvez le voir sur l’image. </p> <div class=text-center> <img class=\\\"img-fluid img-center\\\" src=\" + ___HTML_LOADER_REPLACER_0___ + \" /> </div> <br/> <p> Le code des templiers utilisé chez les scouts en est une variante !

Si tu as un message suivant le code des templiers devant les yeux, il faut donc que tu retrouves quel symbole correspond à quelle lettre. </p> <p> Pour cela tu dois d’abord dessiner 2 grilles non fermées à l’extérieur de 3 cases de hauteur et 3 cases de largeur puis 2 grands X. Ensuite dans toutes les cases de la 2ème grille et dans tous les V du deuxième X, tu mets un point. Il ne te reste plus qu’à compléter avec lettres de l’alphabet dans l’ordre.

On le surnomme aussi le code du « secret des loups » des Scouts et Guides de France. Ce code utilisé pour cacher des messages paraît compliqué mais nous allons te dévoiler son fonctionnement et il n’aura plus aucun secret pour toi ! </p> <div class=text-center> <img class=\\\"img-fluid img-center\\\" src=\" + ___HTML_LOADER_REPLACER_4___ + \" /> </div> </div> </div> <div id=page4> <div class=blockquote> <h1>Etape 2 : Le code « chinois »</h1> <h2>Le code « chinois », comment ça marche ?</h2> <p> Le code « chinois » suit une logique particulière qu’il faut comprendre pour pouvoir décoder facilement. Pour construire un code « chinois », on parcourt d’abord les voyelles dans l’ordre : A, E, I, O, U, Y. Elles sont toutes symbolisées par des lignes horizontales. Pour chaque voyelle, une ligne en plus est ajoutée, cela fonctionne comme sur la photo. </p> <div class=text-center> <img class=\\\"img-fluid img-center\\\" src=\" + ___HTML_LOADER_REPLACER_5___ + \" /> </div> <br/> <p> Puis, on récite les lettres de l’alphabet qui suivent la dernière voyelle obtenue pour faire une nouvelle ligne verticale à chaque consonne. (Pour chaque consonne il y a donc un certain nombre de lignes horizontales qui correspondent à la voyelle présente juste avant la consonne dans l’alphabet et un certain nombre de lignes verticales qui corresponde au nombre de consonnes dans l’alphabet après la voyelle désignée pour atteindre la voyelle qu’on veut écrire.)

Tu te demandes alors mais quelle est la différence entre les 2 ? La réponse est simple, le code « chinois » et le code samouraï fonctionnent de la même façon sauf que, dans le code samouraï les voyelles sont représentées par les lignes verticales et les consonnes par les lignes horizontales (c’est l’inverse du code « chinois » !). </p> <div class=text-center> <img class=\\\"img-fluid img-center\\\" src=\" + ___HTML_LOADER_REPLACER_9___ + \" /> </div> </div> </div> <div id=page6> <div class=blockquote> <h1>Etape 3 : A toi de jouer !</h1> <p> Ta mission, ici, est de décoder le code « samourai » ci-dessous (voyelles en lignes verticales et consonnes en lignes horizontales).

Le lieu de départ de ta course sera votre salon. </p> </div> </div> <div id=page4> <div> <h2>Etape 3</h2> <p> Crée-toi des frises (que tu gardes pour toi) sur lesquelles tu marques l’enchaînement des lieux où tes parents devront aller. Le départ doit toujours être le salon et l’arrivée doit toujours être la même pour tout le monde. </p> <p> Astuce : Tu dois créer une frise par personne qui participera au jeu sinon tout le monde va se suivre. (Tu peux faire le même enchaînement mais décaler d’une étape par personne.) </p> <p> En voilà un exemple : </p> <div class=text-center> <img class=\\\"img-fluid img-center\\\" src=\" + ___HTML_LOADER_REPLACER_0___ + \" alt=\\\"\\\"> </div> </div> </div> <div id=page5> <div> <h2>Etape 4</h2> <div class=text-center> <img class=\\\"img-fluid img-center\\\" src=\" + ___HTML_LOADER_REPLACER_0___ + \" alt=\\\"\\\"> </div> <p> A partir de la première frise : Écris une énigme pour aller du point 1 au point 2, du point 2 au point 3, …., du point 6 au point 7 sur différents morceaux de papiers. Pour cela, sers-toi des différentes méthodes de code apprises dans l’atelier précédent. Varie les énigmes (tu peux utiliser différentes manières de coder, une charade, un rébus…). Écris avec chaque énigme quel code tu utilises, tes parents ne les connaissent pas. Plies chaque papier et écris sur le papier plié pour qui il est. </p> <p> Astuce : Écris sur chaque papier où tu vas devoir le cacher. Par exemple, « salon » pour l’énigme de départ où « sous la table à manger » pour le 2ème papier que doit trouver ton papa. Mais n’écris pas vers quel lieu le papier envoies. Sur chaque papier plier tu pourras alors lire « Papa-lieux où il a le papier ». </p> <p> Pour chaque autre frise : Réécris les mêmes énigmes que pour la première frise. Mais fait attention à chaque frise pour cacher au bon endroit chaque indice ! (Selon l’exemple, l’indice qui envoie sous la table à manger sera donné au départ au papa alors qu’il sera caché derrière la plante du salon pour maman). Et n’oublies pas de préciser pour qui seront les papiers ! </p> <p> Une fois que tout cela est fait, vérifie que tu as tous les papiers pour faire chaque parcours. Et prends une photo de toutes tes énigmes.(Toutes tes énigmes doivent tenir sur une photo et être lisibles) </p> </div> </div> <div id=page6> <div> <h2>Etape 5</h2> <p> Garde toutes les énigmes sur lesquelles tu as écris « salon », que tu donneras en main propre à tes parents et, discrètement, vas cacher les autres énigmes. (A l’endroit qui est marqué sur le papier) </p> <p> Tu n’auras pas d’énigme à cacher au point 7. C’est normal !

phytosanitaires ne sont pas forcément aussi réglementés qu’en Europe.<br> Et ces pesticides sont de plus en plus montrés du doigt sur de nombreux cas de cancers, d’infertilité et autres maladies

Parfois en expliquant voix haute on comprend et on retient mieux le savoir, c'est un vieux truc de druides ! </div> </div> </div> <div id=page3> <div> <h2>Examen surprise !</h2> </div> </div> <div id=page4> <div> <h2>La sécurité du feu</h2> <p>rois choses sont importantes pour faire le feu jeune Gaulois ! Tout d'abord le lieu où tu te trouves, le matériel dont tu disposes et la météo ! Écoute bien les détails de la sagesse ancestrale des sapeurs-druides. </p> <h3>Le lieu</h3> <p>Si tu es dans le sud de la France, à l'année ou en camp, le feu est risqué car le climat méditerranéen est sec. Bien fait, c'est une punition des druides bretons qui ont volé toute la pluie à cause des moqueries des druides du sud, mais ceci est une autre histoire. Renseigne-toi mais il est probable que ce ne soit pas possible. Par contre, les gazs extérieurs (araignées) sont souvent autorisés, tu mangeras quand même rassure-toi. </p> <p> Si tu es dans un lieu plus sauvage, il faudra faire attention à éloigner ce qui peut brûler, à plus de 2m autour, c'est important, promets-moi que tu le feras (je le promets par Bélénos !). Lève aussi la tête, si tu es sous les arbres, il faudra déplacer le feu pour que la fumée ne détruise pas les feuilles (par assèchement et intoxication). </p> <p> Si tu es dans un pré ou un beau jardin, tu pourras creuser un trou, il y a une astuce pour ne pas trop abîmer le paysage. Plante un bâton là où sera ton feu. Attache une ficelle dessus, de la longueur de ton futur trou. Attache un bâton à l'autre bout et tends la ficelle, cela te fait un compas pour tracer les contours du trou. </p> <p> Ensuite, tu prendras une pelle carrée (pas une pelle ronde ! Répète ! Pas une pelle ronde par Toutatis) et tu creuseras en faisant une grille comme un sudoku (sans les chiffres einh). Cela te permettra de creuser des petits morceaux de terre-herbe carrés, que tu poses à côté du feu (pas autour, vous allez les piétiner sinon) </p> <p> Quand vous repartirez, après avoir sécuriser le feu, tu remettras les carrés de terre dans le trou, avec un peu d'eau et un troupeau de bourrins-à-bottes, tu rendras au lieu ça pureté originelle (ce ne sera pas parfait, mais en un mois l'herbe aura repoussé et hop, ni vu ni connux). </p> <p> Pour protéger le lieu, certains rajoutent des pierres autour du feu, comme dans les films. Attention jeune Gaulois ça pourrait péter aussi fort qu'une chanson d'Assurancetourix ! Si tu prends des pierres au bord d'une rivière, ou pire dedans, elles seront trop humide et en séchant si vite elles risquent d'exploser, c'est très dangereux. Prends donc des pierres sèches, loin de la berge de la rivière. Mets les loin du feu pendant 2h histoire de les sécher comme tes chaussettes qui pu... qui sentent fort. </p> <div class=\\\"alert alert-success\\\" role=alert> <h4 class=alert-heading>JEU N°2</h4> Sans relire, essaye de répéter la méthode Gauloise pour creuser un super trou de feu ? Demande à quelqu'un de suivre la feuille pour voir si tu oublies quelque chose ? Relis un peu si tu rates, et réessayes ! </div> <h3>Le matériel</h3> <p> Pour faire ton feu, j'espère que tu as une bonne raison, tu auras besoin de matériel, comme on dit chez les Gaulois, du matos (parce que matox c'était trop pénible à prononcer). Il te faudra du matos pour allumer le feu (une source de chaleur tout bonnement) et du bois bien sûr (le... le... com... finement ? Non ! Le com...? ). </p> <p> Mais avant ces deux choses, il te faudra vérifier d'avoir du matos pour cuisiner sur le feu ET pour éteindre le feu en cas de pépin. Cela rentre dans les règles de sécurité, c'est vital même ! </p> <p> Pour cuisiner chaque village Gaulois a sa méthode : des barres à feu, une table à feu, des cailloux plats, des réchauds à bois (crocodiles...), des grilles, juste des pierres bien plates... Tant que c'est stable. </p> <div class=row> <div class=col> <div class=text-center> <img class=\\\"img-fluid img-center\\\" src=\" + ___HTML_LOADER_REPLACER_1___ + \" alt=\\\"\\\"> </div> </div> <div class=col> <p> Si jamais tu manques de matos pour cuisiner essaie le FEU EN CROIX. </p> <p> Il faut creuser quatre pentes dans le sol et allumer ton feu au milieu. Si la terre est solide, tu poses directement ta popotes sur le feu. Sinon tu peux ajouter des pierres plates aux angles. Pour éteindre le feu, il existe deux méthodes : la noyade ou l'asphyxie. On dirait un truc de sérial-killer pas vrai ? Tout bêtement c'est soit de l'eau, soit du sable (la terre fine peut fonctionner aussi). On ne s'en servira que si le feu devient incontrôlable, pour éviter qu'il ne se propage. Comme un virus de feu, tu vois l'idée ? Bien sûr si on a choisi le bon lieu et maîtrisé les bons gestes de sécurité, il n'y a pas de raison de zigouiller le feu, on le laissera s'éteindre tout seul, sous bonne garde (comme si c'était un Romain quoi !). </p> </div> <div class=col> <div class=text-center> <img class=\\\"img-fluid img-center\\\" src=\" + ___HTML_LOADER_REPLACER_2___ + \" alt=\\\"\\\"> </div> </div> </div> <p> On y pense jamais assez, mais prévoir des gants qui vont au feu (encore un truc de druide cuisinier...) vous sera bien utile, ainsi que des sous-plats en bois, des ustensiles pour tenir (pinces) et piquer (fourchette à barbecue), pour soulever la viande ou le poisson (spatule en métal). La bidouille amène souvent la brûlure et la brûlure mène au côté obscu... non pardon, c'est encore une autre histoire. </p> <div class=\\\"alert alert-success\\\" role=alert> <h4 class=alert-heading>JEU N°3</h4> relis doucement et sans regarder essaye de citer différents matos qu'il te faudra pour faire le feu, demande à quelqu'un de rester avec toi pour te mimer ce que tu as oublié ! Sans parler einh, on ne triche pas ! Le Grand Esprit Gaulois qui voit tout te surveille, BigBrozix. </div> <h3>La météo</h3> <p> Trêve de blagues sudistes sur l'ouest de la Gaule, il est important de prendre en compte la météo, que ce soit du lieu en général ou de la semaine où vous ferez votre camp, votre week-end, bref votre feu. </p> <p> Si la météo annonce beaucoup de pluie, il faudra anticiper cela et bâtir un abri pour le feu, ou demander poliment à le faire dans une grange bien aérée avec un plafond super grand, comme la hutte de notre Grand Chef Gaulois Macronix. Pour faire un abri tout bête, on peut demander à un paysan de découper un bout de tôle de 1m sur 1m, on trouve quatre solides piquets en bois de 2m de haut, qu'on enterre, et qu'on fixe ensemble par le haut avec la tôle. Attention, la tôle coupe, prévoir du scotch « tape » pour couvrir les bords. Si vous avez fait une table à feu, qui sera couverte sous la tôle donc, prévoyez un espace dessous le feu pour stocker le bois, il sera ainsi toujours sec ! </p> <div class=row> <div class=col> <div class=text-center> <img class=\\\"img-fluid img-center\\\" src=\" + ___HTML_LOADER_REPLACER_3___ + \" alt=\\\"\\\"> </div> </div> <div class=col> <p> Idée de table à feu </p> <p> (si tu sais qu'il va pleuvoir souvent, les quatre piquets dans les coins seront tes piquets de 2m pour poser la tôle dessus !) </p> </div> </div> <p> Si la météo annonce beaucoup de vent, par exemple de quoi faire voler une braise sur plus de 2m, il est sage soit d'abriter le feu dans un endroit sans vent (on fait le tour du bâtiment par exemple). Si on ne peut pas abriter le feu, il faut tout simplement abandonner cette idée, c'est trop dangereux. </p> <p> Si la météo annonce une période de sécheresse une semaine avant votre camp ou votre feu, il faut se renseigner sur votre zone. Est-elle considérée comme fragile face aux incendies ? Si c'est dans un champs au milieu de rien avec peu de végétation ou de l'herbe bien verte, cela risque moins. Mais souvent quand il fait trop sec, la préfecture (c'est le chef de toute la région où vous serez) peut interdire le feu exceptionnellement. </p> <div class=\\\"alert alert-success\\\" role=alert> <h4 class=alert-heading>JEU N°4</h4> va embêter quelqu'un dans ta maison ! Demande lui de t'interroger, que fait-on si on sait qu'il va pleuvoir ? Que fait-on si on sait qu'il y aura beaucoup de vent ? Que fait-on si on sait qu'il fera très sec ? </div> </div> </div> <div id=page5> <div> <h2>Examen sur la sécurité du feu !</h2> </div> </div> <div id=page6> <div> <h2>L'Art de construire un feu</h2> <p> Bon... tu sais comment on fait du feu, il te manque deux choses, comment on l'allume concrètement et comment monter ton feu. On va s'intéresser à ce dernier point d'abord. </p> <p> Pour construire, ou bâtir un feu, il faut monter en hauteur, peu importe comment on s'y prend.

Ils produisent une flamme directement, très pratique. </p> <p> L'ÉTINCELLE : les plus accessibles sont dans la famille des percussions, la pierre-à-feu et le briquet à silex. </p> <div class=row> <div class=col> <p> La pierre à feu est une tige de ferrocerium qui, frottée avec du métal, va décrocher des petits morceaux, la violence du choc au contact de l'air va créer des étincelles qui peuvent monter jusque 2000 degrés ! </p> </div> <div class=col> <div class=text-center> <img class=\\\"img-fluid img-center\\\" src=\" + ___HTML_LOADER_REPLACER_5___ + \" alt=\\\"\\\"> </div> </div> <div class=col> <div class=text-center> <img class=\\\"img-fluid img-center\\\" src=\" + ___HTML_LOADER_REPLACER_6___ + \" alt=\\\"\\\"> </div> </div> <div class=col> <p> Le briquet à silex est une pièce de fer qui en tapant sur une pierre trés dure (silex, pyrite, marcassite) va décrocher des petits morceaux ... étincelles... Dans 2 cas on voit bien qu'il faut un petit amadou pour attraper les étincelles </p> </div> </div> <p> L'INCANDESCENCE : c'est le top de la difficulté, à essayer cet été pendant le camp. On va accumuler assez de chaleur au même point pour que la matière s'embrase d'elle-même. Avec la braise obtenue on peut espérer allumer une flamme en réunissant une grosse boule d'amadou (feuilles sèches, herbes, écorce, aiguilles de pin). On l'obtient avec 3 sources : la foudre (dur à trouver), le soleil, la friction. Pour le soleil on peut utiliser une loupe ou un briquet solaire spécialement prévu pour. Pour la friction c'est costaud et demande des mois d'entraînement </p> <div class=text-center> <img class=\\\"img-fluid img-center\\\" src=\" + ___HTML_LOADER_REPLACER_7___ + \" alt=\\\"\\\"> </div> <div class=\\\"alert alert-success\\\" role=alert> <h4 class=alert-heading>JEU N°6</h4> Mets toi derrière la fenêtre quand il fait beau, tu sens la chaleur ?

Plus l’échelle d’une carte topographique est petite, moins les détails seront précis. Grâce aux signes sur une carte topographique, tu as vite fait de retrouver une route, une rivière ou un joli point de vue à ne pas manquer. </p> </div> </div> <div id=page4> <div> <h2>Etape 1 : Utiliser une carte</h2> <h3>La carte : les grands principes</h3> <p> Quand tu lis une carte, il faut absolument que tu penses à ces principes : </p> <h4>Le Nord est l’élément essentiel de l’orientation ! </h4> <p> Il commande tout le reste car si tu trouves le nord, avec la rose des vents, tu trouves les autres directions. Et surtout, toutes les cartes sont orientées vers le Nord. </p> <p> Il faut savoir qu’il existe deux types de Nord : le Nord géographique (qui correspond au Nord sur ta carte) et magnétique (qui correspond au Nord de la terre). Sur de longs voyages cela peut faire dévier si on ne prend pas cela en compte. Pour une petite randonnée, ça ne change rien ! </p> <h4>Le quadrillage est présent sur toutes les cartes. </h4> <p> Il est très utile et tu ne dois pas hésiter à t’en servir. Il est droit et tu peux donc caler ta boussole le long d’une ligne pour être sûr(e) de la direction à prendre. </p> </div> </div> <div id=page5> <div> <h2>Etape 1 : Utiliser une carte</h2> <h3>La carte : la légende</h3> <p> Pour te repérer avec une carte, tu dois toujours avoir en tête leur fonctionnement qui est toujours le même. Tu pourras alors lire au mieux la carte et surtout prévoir le type de reliefs que tu vas croiser et la distance que tu vas faire. </p> <h4>L’échelle te permet de lire la carte et d’évaluer les distances.</h4> <p> C’est le rapport mathématique entre une longueur sur la carte et la longueur réelle sur le terrain. </p> <p> Elle s'exprime par une fraction où le numérateur représente la longueur sur la carte et le dénominateur représente la longueur réelle sur le terrain. Par exemple, si tu lis 1 : 25000 ça veut dire qu’un centimètre sur ta carte correspond à 25 000 cm dans la réalité. </p> <p> Une autre manière d’écrire l’échelle sur une carte est de tracer un trait d’un certain nombre de centimètres et d’écrire à quelle distance la longueur du trait sur la carte correspond dans la réalité. Tu peux en voir un exemple ci-contre. </p> <div class=text-center> <img class=\\\"img-fluid img-center\\\" src=\" + ___HTML_LOADER_REPLACER_1___ + \" alt=\\\"\\\"> </div> <p> Si aucune échelle n’est notée sur la carte, c’est qu’elle est en taille réelle. </p> <h4>Le quadrillage est présent sur toutes les cartes. </h4> <p> Il est très utile et tu ne dois pas hésiter à t’en servir.

Quand on sait lire les courbes de niveau, on peut connaître son altitude, mais aussi le profil d’un itinéraire (si ça va monter ou descendre) et même connaître les cols, les sommets, les crêtes etc…. </p> <p> Dans la légende, il est noté à combien de dénivelé correspond la distance entre 2 cercles. En comptant le nombre de cercle et en multipliant ce nombre par le dénivelé correspondant, tu pourras savoir combien de mètres vont être montés ou descendus. </p> <div class=text-center> <img class=\\\"img-fluid img-center\\\" src=\" + ___HTML_LOADER_REPLACER_2___ + \" alt=\\\"\\\"> </div> <p> Pour savoir si tu vas monter ou descendre, regarde les informations sur la carte.

Tu es sûrement assis(e) dans une pièce. Fixe un endroit dans la pièce, à l’opposé de là où tu es. Ton objectif, en faisant une ligne droite, rends-toi à l’endroit que tu as fixé. Si tu croises des obstacles, (et que tu peux les passer en toute sécurité), ne dévies pas de ta direction.

Quand on te donne un azimut, il est possible que tu rencontres un obstacle et que tu doives t’en détourner.

Frotte toujours dans le même sens pour magnétiser l’épingle. </p> <p> Verse de l’eau dans un bol, place l’aiguille sur le support flottant et le tout sur l’eau. L’aiguille va tourner et ralentir pour finir dans la direction Nord-Sud. Le test marchera normalement même si ton aimant n’est pas très puissant. </p> <p> Astuce : Si tu n’as pas d’aimant, frotte l’aiguille dans tes cheveux, en faisant attention (fais le doucement et avec personne autour pour te bousculer). Avec l’électricité statique, ça marchera normalement. </p> <h4>Comment ça marche?</h4> <p> Chaque aimant a un pôle sud et un pôle nord. L’aiguille d’une boussole est un petit aimant qui va s’aligner avec les pôles magnétiques de la Terre (qui sont proches pôles géographiques). En frottant une aiguille sur un aimant, on la rend magnétique et en la plaçant sur un support flottant, on lui permet de s’aligner avec les pôles Nord et Sud. </p> </div> </div> <div id=page12> <div> <h2>Etape 3 : Se repérer quand on est perdu</h2> <p> Quand tu es perdu(e) dans la nature, il y a plusieurs moyens pour toi de retrouver où tu es. </p> <p> Une des solutions, la plus facile est de monter (monter une pente, chercher un point plus haut, accessible autour de toi), pour voir, depuis ce point en hauteur ce qu’il y a autour de toi et essayer de te repérer. </p> </div> </div> <div id=page13> <div> <h2>Etape 3 : Se repérer quand on est perdu</h2> <p> Une autre solution pour essayer de te repérer, si tu ne peux pas aller en hauteur, est d’observer ce qu’il y a autour de toi, de réfléchir à ce que tu as vu sur le chemin pour en arriver là.

Ils sont basés sur un principe simple : on décale l’alphabet d’un certain nombre de lettres. Par exemple A devient F, B devient G etc… jusqu’à Z devient E. On peut aussi utiliser des chiffres. A devient 6, B devient 7 etc… jusqu’à Z qui devient 5. </p> <p> Certains codes sont très célèbres car on peut glisser la clé de codage dans un seul mot (ou un dessin). C’est le cas pour celui que tu connais surement qui est AVOCAT (A vaut K). </p> <p> Pour te faire découvrir certains nouveaux codes à décalages, voici un mini jeu : ta mission est de relier le nom du code à la relation entre 2 lettres (ou entre une lettre et un chiffre) à laquelle il correspond ! Passes à la suite quand tu as fini, si tu as juste, tu verras la page suivante s’afficher ! </p> <div class=row> <div class=col> <h3>Cassette</h3> </div> <div class=col> <h3>A=T</h3> </div> </div> <div class=row> <div class=col> <h3>L’inverse</h3> </div> <div class=col> <h3>D=3</h3> </div> </div> <div class=row> <div class=col> <h3>Elle aime</h3> </div> <div class=col> <h3>A=Z</h3> </div> </div> <div class=row> <div class=col> <h3>Ciseau</h3> </div> <div class=col> <h3>L=N</h3> </div> </div> <div class=row> <div class=col> <h3>Œuf pourri</h3> </div> <div class=col> <h3>R=V</h3> </div> </div> <div class=row> <div class=col> <h3>Déesse</h3> </div> <div class=col> <h3>6=O</h3> </div> </div> <div class=row> <div class=col> <h3>Idée</h3> </div> <div class=col> <h3>I=D</h3> </div> </div> <div class=row> <div class=col> <h3>Détroit</h3> </div> <div class=col> <h3>D=S</h3> </div> </div> <div class=row> <div class=col> <h3>Indienne</h3> </div> <div class=col> <h3>1=N</h3> </div> </div> <div class=row> <div class=col> <h3>Hervé</h3> </div> <div class=col> <h3>F=L</h3> </div> </div> <div class=row> <div class=col> <h3>Hélène</h3> </div> <div class=col> <h3>J=O</h3> </div> </div> <div class=row> <div class=col> <h3>Eiffel</h3> </div> <div class=col> <h3>L=M</h3> </div> </div> <div class=row> <div class=col> <h3>JO</h3> </div> <div class=col> <h3>K=7</h3> </div> </div> <div class=row> <div class=col> <h3>A voté</h3> </div> <div class=col> <h3>E=I</h3> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div id=page3> <div> <h2>Etape 1 : Découvre les codes</h2> <h3>Le code à décalage : Le chiffrement et le déchiffrement mais Quésako ?</h3> <h4> Le chiffrement </h4> <p> Le chiffrement correspond au moment où tu codes ton message. Par exemple, si tu utilises A=K et que tu veux que celui qui suis ta piste trouvent la lettre A, tu notes K. </p> <h4> Le déchiffrement </h4> <p> Le déchiffrement, c’est l’inverse, c’est le moment où l’on décode un message. Avec A=K, si le joueur voit K écrit, il doit remonter à la lettre A pour comprendre ton message. Par contre, si le joueur voit la lettre A écrite, il doit remonter à la lettre Q. </p> <p> Quand tu codes un message, tu dois donc faire attention aux lettres que tu écris. Par exemple pour coder « bonjour », avec le code Avocat, tu notes « lyxtyeb ». </p> <p> Voici un mini jeu pour t’entrainer, passe à la page suivante quand tu as trouvé la réponse aux 2 questions ? </p> <p> Comment code-t-on (chiffre-t-on) « elephant » avec le code avocat ? <br> Quel mot correspond le mot «qsbkpo » codé avec avocat ? </p> </div> </div> <div id=page4> <div> <h2>Etape 1 : Découvre les codes</h2> <h3>Le code à décalage : Le chiffrement et le déchiffrement mais Quésako ?</h3> <p> Comment code-t-on (chiffre-t-on) « elephant » avec le code avocat ? <br> La réponse était « ovozrkxd ». </p> <p> Quel mot correspond le mot «qsbkpo » codé avec avocat ? <br> La réponse était « girafe ». </p> <p> Si tu as compris le principe, passes à la page suivante ! </p> </div> </div> <div id=page5> <div> <h2>Etape 1 : Découvre les codes</h2> <h3>Découvres le code à transposition (Etape 1)</h3> <p> Pour faire un code à transposition, le message que tu veux écrire est copié dans une grille en colonne puis tu recopie les lettres lignes par lignes pour former le code ce qui provoque un mélange de lettre.

Tu peux inventer ton propre alphabet, mais, dans ce cas, tu dois donner à la personne qui décode ton alphabet avec les lettres correspondant à chaque symbole. Ou alors tu peux utiliser un code à symbole qui existe déjà comme le morse ou le code des templiers. </p> </div> </div> <div id=page10> <div> <h2>Etape 1 : Découvre les codes</h2> <h3> Comment les codes peuvent être complexifiés ?</h3> <p> Quand tu connais les bonnes techniques, tu peux décoder n’importe quels codes en 2 minutes chrono. Voici 2 méthodes pour rendre un code plus difficile ! </p> <h4> Le surcodage </h4> <p> Le surcodage consiste à coder 2 fois de suite le même message avec 2 codes secrets différents. </p> <p> Attention à ne pas utiliser deux codes à décalage (Avocat, Cassis…), car ça agrandira (ou réduira) seulement le décalage sans le surcoder. (Si ton premier code A=1, et que ton second code 1=B, alors A=B). Tu peux utiliser 2 codes à décalage uniquement si ton premier code est à lettres et le 2ème à chiffre et lettre. </p> <p> Voici un exemple, codé en Avocat (A=K), puis cassis (K=6) :<br> En clair : Ceci est un message <br> En Avocat : moms ocd ex wocckqo <br> En cassis : 8.10.8.14..10.24.25..26.19..18.10.24.24.6.12.10. </p> <p> Si tu le souhaites, tu peux t’entrainer à décoder en décodant d’abord le code codé en cassis puis celui en avocat. Regarde si tu retrouves « ceci est un message ». </p> </div> </div> <div id=page11> <div> <h2>Etape 1 : Découvre les codes</h2> <h3> Comment les codes peuvent être complexifiés ?</h3> <h4> L'écriture à l'envers </h4> <p> L’écriture à l’envers consiste à écrire la phrase à l’envers puis à coder cette phrase écrite à l’envers. </p> <p> Voici un exemple, mis à l’envers puis codé en Hélène (L=N) :<br> En clair : Un code plus difficile <br> A l’envers : eliciffid sulp edoc nu <br> En Hélène : gnkekhhkf uwnr gfqe pw. </p> <p> Si tu le souhaites, tu peux t’entrainer à décoder en décodant d’abord le code codé en Hélène puis remettant le texte à l’endroit. Regarde si tu retrouves « un code plus difficile ». </p> </div> </div> <div id=page12> <div> <h2>Etape 2 : Suis la piste…</h2> <h3>Règles du jeu</h3> <p> Ton objectif est simple, résous le premier code, suis les indications et tu réussiras à sortir de la piste… Tous les codes que tu vas croiser sur ta piste seront des codes à décalage, à toi de trouver quel code à décalage est utilisé à chaque fois. 2 phrases différentes ne sont pas codées avec le même code.

Parfois elles sont progressives (petit, moyen, grand, très grand) et parfois c'est le bazar, c'est pour ça que la nature nous surprend autant et qu'il faut se balader toujours à droite à gauche pour apprendre, comparer. </p> <div class=text-center> <img class=\\\"img-fluid img-center\\\" src=\" + ___HTML_LOADER_REPLACER_1___ + \" alt=\\\"Les différentes strates, de la strate muscinale à la strate arborée en passant par les strates herbacée et arbustive\\\"> </div> <table class=\\\"table table-responsive\\\"> <tr> <th>Strate muscinale</th> <th>Strate herbacée</th> <th>Strate arbustive</th> <th>Strate arborée</th> </tr> <tr> <td>1-9 cm</td> <td>10-80 cm</td> <td>1-10 m</td> <td>11-30 m</td> </tr> <tr> <td> Sol et espèces rampantes (mousses, lichens, plantes naines, champignons) </td> <td>Plantes basses (fleurs, fougères, bruyère, ronces, orties)</td> <td>Plantes hautes et petits arbres (houx, buis, arbres ados)</td> <td>Arbres hauts (végétaux ligneux = arbres)</td> </tr> <tr> <td> Habille le sol et le rend réceptif aux graines, attire insectes rampants et les petits rongeurs </td> <td> Garde l'humidité à la surface, attire du gibier (petit et grand), des insectes (chenilles, abeilles…) </td> <td> Produit de la matière morte (bois, feuille) et attire les oiseaux communs (repas et abri) </td> <td> Ombre + humidité du sous-bois, feuilles et fruits tombants.

Les plantes ne sont pas assez durables pour estimer l'âge d'une zone naturelle, alors que les arbres eux, même s'ils ont une croissance rapide, on peut compter leur âge, selon la taille des arbres, leurs formes, leur nombre etc… </p> <p> Cela peut aider dans plein de situation. Par exemple si un jour tu deviens expert au FBI, tu vois une vidéo d'un kidnapping, dans le fond tu apercevras les arbres et tu diras… « les kidnappeurs sont dans un perchis, 50-70 ans d'âge, du hêtre, la forêt est exposée plein sud, je vois du saule donc il y a une rivière pas loin ». Bam ! Tu viens de résoudre une enquête juste avec ton savoir ! Plus sérieusement, cela sert à plein de choses, mieux connaître la nature est la clé pour mieux la respecter. Le photographe animalier qui voudrait voir des oiseaux, doit rapidement apprendre qu'une zone de semis et de gaulis n'offre pas beaucoup d'insectes donc peu d'oiseaux. Par contre une vieille futaie, pleine de vieux arbres abîmés, donc colonisés par des insectes… </p> <p>Les étapes de vie d'un arbre sont</p> <ul> <li> La croissance (de la graine à l'arbuste) = 10% de la durée du cycle = rapide ! </li> <li> La maturation (ralentissement de la croissance) = 33% = lent, des décennies. </li> <li> Le vieillissement (bois mort sur branches, écorce usée) = 33% = lent également </li> <li> L'écroulement (mortalité accrue des arbres) = -20% = lent mais inexorable </li> <li> La régénération (fruits > graines > semis) = -10% = rapide, en quelques années hop ! un nouvel arbre ! </li> </ul> <div class=text-center> <img class=\\\"img-fluid img-center\\\" src=\" + ___HTML_LOADER_REPLACER_4___ + \" alt=\\\"Illustration du cycle de vie des arbres\\\"> </div> </div> <div id=page3> <h2>Jeu n°2</h2> <p> Remets les strates de la forêt dans le bon ordre (si tu peux redire rapidement à quoi elles correspondent, ça nous ferait un bon pense-bête !).

On peut dire pour simplifier « ceux qui ont de la sève et d'autres non » ou bien « ceux qui ont de la résine et d'autres non ». En fait on les distingue selon l'épaisseur de leur sève, pour faire simple. Cela donne des différences en terme de verdure. </p> <ul> <li> Les arbres avec de la sève ont des feuilles, on dit donc des FEUILLUS. </li> <li> Les arbres avec de la résine ont des aiguilles, on dit donc… des RÉSINEUX <small>(cherche pas c'est comme ça…)</small> </li> </ul> <p> On t'as mis une fiche un tableau « classification » créé par l'Office National des Forêts (ONF) avec cette fiche, va donc lire la et amuse toi à comprendre comment fonctionnent les sous-familles d'arbres. Rappelle- toi que cette fiche ne montre pas tous les arbres du monde, dans certaines catégories tu n'en verras qu'un, mais bien sûr il en existe bien plus dans chaque famille. </p> <p> Pour la suite, voici 4 fiches des arbres le plus courant que l'on rencontre dans le scoutix.

Dans ce sens, c'est une limitation physique ou psychique. En effet, il existe plusieurs types de handicap, en voici quelques uns : </p> <p> <strong>Le handicap moteur :</strong> c’est l’ensemble des problèmes entraînant une atteinte partielle ou totale de la motricité, par exemple des membres supérieurs (ex : bras) et/ou inférieurs (ex : jambes). C’est une difficulté pour se déplacer, conserver ou changer une position, prendre et manipuler, effectuer certains gestes. </p> <div class=text-center> <img class=img-center src=\" + ___HTML_LOADER_REPLACER_0___ + \"> </div> </div> <p> <strong>Le handicap sensoriel </strong> regroupe les difficultés liées aux organes sensoriels comme par exemple : <strong>le handicap visuel</strong>, qui concerne les personnes aveugles, mais aussi, dans la majorité des cas, les personnes malvoyantes. </p> <div class=text-center> <img class=img-center src=\" + ___HTML_LOADER_REPLACER_1___ + \"> </div> </div> <p> <strong>Le handicap mental ou intellectuel :</strong> c’est une difficulté à comprendre et une limitation dans la rapidité des fonctions mentales sur le plan de la compréhension, des connaissances et de la cognition. </p> <div class=text-center> <img class=img-center src=\" + ___HTML_LOADER_REPLACER_2___ + \"> </div> </div> <h3>Est-ce que tous les handicaps se voient ?</h3> <p> Non, il existe plusieurs types de handicap, dont certains qui ne se voient pas comme par exemple parfois l’autisme. Par exemple, certains chercheurs pensent aujourd’hui que Einstein aurait été autiste Asperger (c’est une forme de handicap mental). </p> <p> <strong>Peut-on être scout et en situation de handicap ? </strong> </p> <p> Oui ! Chez les scouts, on accueille tout le monde, régulièrement des unités accueillent des jeunes handicapés. De plus, il existe une branche chez les Scouts et Guides de France dédiée spécifiquement aux personnes majeures en situation de handicap, elle s’appelle : « vent du large ». Il existe aussi un groupe « Arc en ciel » à Marseille qui n’accueille que des jeunes en situation de handicap mental ou moteur. </p>   <div id=page3> <div> <h2>Troisième temps</h2> <p> Le troisième temps de cette activité est une activité manuelle sensibilisant au handicap moteur : la dyspraxie. </p> <p class=font-italic>Consigne : Pour comprendre mieux et ressentir ce qu’est le handicap moteur réalise ces étapes l’une après l’autre.</p> <ol> <li>Ecris sur une feuille la phrase suivante (il faut que les mots soient assez espacés entre eux) : <span class=font-italic>« Le handicap, la différence sont une forme de singularité, qui mettent en avant d'autres qualités insoupçonnées. »</span></li> <li>Maintenant, mets des gants de ski ou des gants de jardinage.

Les centurions n’étant pas là, vous en profitez pour discuter jusqu’au bout de la nuit. Léa, la seule jeune engagée, est fatiguée et vous le fait savoir. <p class=font-italic> Pistes de réflexion : Bien dormir permet d’être en forme et de vivre à fond le camp, l’explo, le weekend, etc. et le respect du sommeil des autres est très important dans la vie en commun. </p> </div> </div> <div id=page3> <div> <div class=\\\"alert alert-warning\\\"> <h4 class=alert-header>Réponse précédente</h4> Dans cette situation, vous aurez encore toute la journée du lendemain en équipage pour vous raconter vos vies donc le mieux est de se coucher pour pouvoir profiter au maximum de votre deuxième jour d’explo . </div> Chouette !

Il est important d’avoir dans son sac des affaires adaptées à la météo du camp ou du weekend. </div> Premier jour de camp, les centurions vous demandent de faire des équipes pour les installations communes. <p class=font-italic> Pistes de réflexion : Tu as sans doute très envie d’être en équipe avec tes copains/copines.

Thomas, nouveau de cette année et pas très drôle, se met à pleurer comme tous les soirs depuis le début de la campagne. <p class=font-italic> Pistes de réflexion : Chacun·e ressent des émotions selon les situations qu’il ou elle vit et les exprime différemment, ça ne doit pas être le sujet de moqueries. </p> </div> </div> <div id=page6> <div> <div class=\\\"alert alert-warning\\\"> <h4 class=alert-header>Réponse précédente</h4> Si tu es témoin d’une situation telle que celle-ci, et selon ta sensibilité, tu peux demander directement à la personne concernée si elle a besoin de quelque chose. Préviens également tes chefs et cheftaines pour qu’ils puissent aider ce scout ou cette guide. </div> Depuis 2 mois, vous accueillez une jeune en fauteuil roulant dans la tribu, Sonia. Elle ne vient pas à toutes les réunions mais franchement, tu la trouves cool ! Aujourd’hui elle est présente et c’est le jeu de l’année : un gigantesque poule-renard-vipère préparé par les chefs auquel Sonia pense ne pas pouvoir jouer. <p class=font-italic> Pistes de réflexion : Il existe plein de moyen d’adapter des jeux pour inclure tout le monde dans la partie. </p> </div> </div> <div id=page7> <div> <div class=\\\"alert alert-warning\\\"> <h4 class=alert-header>Réponse précédente</h4> Il est important de tenir compte de l’avis de la personne concernée sur comment elle a envie de participer. Peut-être que surveiller la prison et crier quand un renard s’approche lui convient mais attention à ne pas lui imposer une place qu’elle n’a pas choisie : la place pour « handicapé ». Après tout, elle a peut-être aussi envie de dévaler la pente en fauteuil et en ayant une personne de plus dans l’équipe, vous pouvez vous relayer pour pousser le fauteuil de Sonia et lui permettre de jouer un maximum. </div> Un de tes copains t’avoue avec beaucoup de difficultés que parfois son papa lui donne des coups... (il est vrai que tu avais déjà remarqué dans la tente ses nombreux bleus dans le dos et sur les jambes). </div> </div> <div id=page8> <div> <div class=\\\"alert alert-warning\\\"> <h4 class=alert-header>Réponse précédente</h4> Cette situation peut sembler te dépasser complètement, tu n’es pas sûr de tout comprendre mais tu sais que ça peut être grave. Tu peux décider - avec l’accord de la personne concernée - d’en parler à l’un de vos chefs. Tu peux également lui demander s’il en a déjà parler à quelqu’un et lui conseiller de trouver un adulte en qui il a confiance pour en discuter. N’aie pas peur d’en parler (sans jamais accuser quelqu’un si ce n’est pas toi la victime)... Et si aucun adulte proche de toi n’est suffisamment digne de confiance, tu peux téléphoner au 119, c’est un numéro gratuit où les enfants peuvent venir confier leurs problèmes. </div> Prendre soin de soi (santé, émotions, sommeil, etc.) est important pour être bien dans son corps et dans sa tête. Dans ta tribu et dans ton équipage, vous êtes entre scouts et guides pour vivre ensemble : rire, vous aider, jouer, relever des défis et pleins d’autres aventures. Vous pouvez compter les uns sur les autres et tes chefs et cheftaines sont également là pour toi. </div> </div> </div>\";\n// Exports\nmodule.exports = code;","module.exports = \"data:image/png;base64,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\"","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"img/1.4afe818f.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"img/Feu_firesteel.f5676f70.jpg\";","module.exports = \"data:image/png;base64,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\"","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"img/19 - Dessine ta vie scout_Logo SGDF.4aac5bcd.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"img/5_maracas_yaourt.49826416.jpg\";","// Module\nvar code = \"<div class=container> <div id=page1> <h2>Question 1</h2> <h3>Le sais-tu ?</h3> <p>sais-tu comment retrouver ton chemin grâce au soleil ?</p> <p>Après avoir réfléchi, que tu aies la réponse ou pas, regarde plus bas</p> <h3>Quelques indices pour trouver la réponse</h3> <details> <p> Comment surnomme-t-on le Japon ? <br> Pourquoi la Bretagne est-elle connue pour ses couchers de soleil ? </p> <p>Regarde plus bas pour voir la réponse</p> </details> <h3>Le savais-tu ?</h3> <details> <p> Le Japon est souvent surnommé le Pays du soleil levant.

C’est-à-dire qu’on regarde quelle distance sur la carte donne quelle distance dans la réalité puis on mesure la distance sur la carte et on calcule la distance réelle. </p> <p> La deuxième façon est plus facile : les distances sont parfois écrites sur les chemins. </p> </details> </div> <div id=page5> <h2>Question 5</h2> <h3>Le sais-tu ?</h3> <p>Pourquoi l’eau est-elle importante pour les scouts ?</p> <p>Après avoir réfléchi, que tu aies la réponse ou pas, regarde plus bas</p> <h3>Le savais-tu ?</h3> <details> <p> Le corps humain est constitué de 70% d’eau. L’hydratation est donc importante pour le fonctionnement du corps. Il est important qu’un scout boive beaucoup pour combler les pertes dues à la transpiration, au fonctionnement des reins, et à la pratique de toute activité (même celle de se laver). </p> </details> </div> <div id=page6> <h2>Question 6</h2> <h3>Le sais-tu ?</h3> <p>Comment savoir où est l’eau sur ton chemin ?</p> <p>Après avoir réfléchi, que tu aies la réponse ou pas, regarde plus bas</p> <h3>Quelques indices pour trouver la réponse</h3> <details> <p> Il existe 3 familles qui permettent de trouver l’eau : la famille des naturels, la famille des humains et la famille des animaux. Que faut-il observer dans chacune des familles pour trouver l’eau ? </p> <p>Regarde plus bas pour voir la réponse</p> </details> <h3>Le savais-tu ?</h3> <details> <p> Dans la famille des naturels, on repère où est l’eau grâce </p> <ul> <li>À la végétation car les plantes ont besoin d’eau pour pousser</li> <li> Aux vallées (pentes…) et aux chemins sinueux (qui sont des anciens lits de rivières) qui te rapprochent de l’eau </li> </ul> <p> Dans la famille des animaux, on repère où est l’eau en suivant les traces des animaux. Ils ont autant besoin d’eau que nous. Donc, des traces convergentes de gibiers mènent forcément à l’eau. </p> <p> Dans la famille des humains, on repère l’eau car on sait que tout humain a besoin d’eau pour vivre. Pour cela, loin de la civilisation, on suit les traces de pas qui mèneront sûrement à un puit, une source ou un trou d’eau. On peut aussi guetter les ponts, les barrages et les panneaux qui les indiquent également. </p> </details> </div> <div id=page7> <h2>Question 7</h2> <h3>Le sais-tu ?</h3> <p> Dans la famille des animaux, les insectes sont un bon guide pour trouver l’eau. On sait par exemple que les fourmis ont une réserve d’eau très proche. Sais-tu dans quel périmètre autour des ruches d’abeilles on peut trouver de l’eau ? Et dans quel périmètre autour des mouches on peut trouver de l’eau ? </p> <p>Après avoir réfléchi, que tu aies la réponse ou pas, regarde plus bas</p> <h3>Le savais-tu ?</h3> <details> <p> Les ruches d’abeilles se trouvent à moins de 5 km de l’eau et les mouches sont à moins de 90 m de l’eau. </p> </details> </div> </div>\";\n// Exports\nmodule.exports = code;","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"img/9_jonglage1.902dc9d0.png\";","// Module\nvar code = \"<div class=container> <div id=page1> <div> Nous allons te proposer des situations d’urgence.

Si tu n’en as pas, soit inventif ou, exceptionnellement, ne protège pas ta table. </p> <p> Astuce : pour fixer un tendeur à une bâche, on utilise un petit caillou ça évite d’arracher les œillets. </p> <div class=text-center> <iframe width=560 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/KZs_akmE-cc frameborder=0 allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </div> <div class=text-center> <img class=\\\"img-fluid img-center\\\" src=\" + ___HTML_LOADER_REPLACER_26___ + \" alt=\\\"\\\"> </div> </div> </div> <div id=page11> <div> </div> </div> </div>\";\n// Exports\nmodule.exports = code;","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"img/grille.cdbe003b.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"img/26.18f81dfa.jpg\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"img/toque3.0f72b9b6.jpg\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"img/marionnettes.9691f7e1.jpg\";","import mod from \"-!../../../node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-0!../../../node_modules/css-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-1!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/loaders/stylePostLoader.js!../../../node_modules/postcss-loader/src/index.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-2!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./ValidationModal.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=255056fa&scoped=true&lang=css&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../../node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-0!../../../node_modules/css-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-1!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/loaders/stylePostLoader.js!../../../node_modules/postcss-loader/src/index.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-2!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./ValidationModal.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=255056fa&scoped=true&lang=css&\"","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"img/10.585e4341.jpg\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"img/19 - Dessine ta vie scout_Affiche.cde36a81.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"img/fiche-hetre.ec79aa56.jpg\";","// Module\nvar code = \"<div class=container> <div id=page1> <div> Le balayage corporel consiste à se concentrer sur son corps et à le passer en revue zone par après zone dans un ordre précis et de manière progressive (de bas en haut ou de haut en bas, en position assise ou couchée).
